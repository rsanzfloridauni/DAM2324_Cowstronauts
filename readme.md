## About <a name = "about"></a>

Cowstronauts is an incremental game influenced by Cookie clicker or Idle Slayer. The main objective of the game is to repair your spaceship to go back to the earth.

In this game you can earn Zlotys, the currency we will use to buy upgrades and repair our ship. Once we get enough Zlotys to go back to our planet, we can see the final of the game or continue playing to it.
